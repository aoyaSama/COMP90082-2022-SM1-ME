# Sprint 1 Assessment Checklist
This checklist helps you double check your work for Sprint 1. 


## Background description, client goals, motivation
Who is the Client, what do they want, why do they want it? This information is sometimes captured in the form of a Motivational Model document. It includes high-level goals, a broad scope, and justification for the project. It may also indicate, at a high-level, how introducing the system/changes will change stakeholder behaviour.

- [ ] You have produced an excellent description of the project (or excellent resources) that accurately and adequately defines the problem and outlines the scope of the solution.
- [ ] Arguments are logical. 
- [ ] The background document is clearly laid out and well structured. 
- [ ] The document contains no typos or spelling errors. With minimal grammatical or spelling mistakes. 
- [ ] DO-BE-FEEL list, DO-BE-FEEL hierarchy and GOAL MODEL are well presented. 
- [ ] The goal model is consistent with the client understanding of the problem and with DO-BE-FEEL list and DO-BE-FEEL hierarchy.



## Personas
Make sure that your Personas satisfies the following criteria:

- [ ] 2-3 personas were developed to help with requirements validation.
- [ ] Personas are based on the research done by students and the discussion with industry partners.
- [ ] Personas represent a sufficiently wide range of behaviours of target users for the system.
- [ ] Personas are inclusive and diverse.
- [ ] Personas present distinct behaviours and do not overlap (unless justified by the students).
- [ ] Personas present a rich description of the users and give a good understanding of the person's motivation and behaviour.
- [ ] The presentation of the personas is elegant and attractive, they are well written, clear, without ambiguities or typos.


## Analysis of requirements (User Stories or Use Cases)
What does the system need to do? Are there any constraints on how it needs to do it? This information needs to cover both functional and non-functional aspects of the proposed system and can be in the form of user stories or use cases, supplementary specification of design/implementation/deployment requirements, prototypes, and others. It may also be necessary to be explicit about what is not in scope to define the scope boundary more clearly.

- [ ] The analysis of requirements was performed on most of the existing requirements. 
- [ ] The [new set of] requirements is consistent to the scope of the project, completely cover the new capabilities required by the client and are well documented/structured/organized on Confluence.
- [ ] The requirements can be documented in the form of user stories or use cases, supplementary specification of design/implementation/deployment requirements, prototypes, and others. It may also be necessary to be explicit about what is not in scope to define the scope boundary more clearly.

## Development environment
What environment do you need setup to conduct the project? Your team will need tools and technologies for supporting the software development processes (e.g. Confluence and Trello), for the development stack including testing, and more broadly for devops and deployment. The team members will need instructions and assistance to set up a consistent set (the right versions) of the tools and technologies to be able to conduct the project, as a team.

- [ ] Confluence is organized (cover page, project details, requirements, technical details about the project, meeting minutes and so on). 
- [ ] Trello (or Github projects) is created, structured and organized. 
- [ ] Great board and great use of the tool so far (students have been creating/updating tasks).
- [ ] Students documented the README file with details about the project, workflow (branches/naming conventions and so on).

## Plan
What needs to be done after inception? This needs to be more detailed for the immediate activities, be clear about priorities, and may be subject to proposed Client feedback or technical evaluation, itself part of the plan. The detail would typically be in Trello, Jira, MS-Project or other tool, with some supporting material, such as a rationale for the next Sprint.

- [ ] Students have a clear idea on what to do next (requirements to develop, technologies to use, infrastructure to deploy the project) for Sprint 2 and Sprint 3. 
- [ ] Requirements were estimated and prioritized.
- [ ] Backlog items can be found in Trello (or Github project).


## Meetings
Make sure your meetings (team meetings, supervision meetings and meetings with industry partners) are documented in Confluence (and only). 

- [ ] Meetings are recorded in Confluence and only. They were NOT exported to Github as they're part of internal process.


## GitHub 
Make sure that: 

- [ ] Folders are structured (On Canvas, visit Assignment -> "Sprint 1: Confluence Space, project background and elicitation documents" page: you can find requirements for folders' structure.)
- [ ] Sprint 1 documents were exported from Confluence and added to the repository (and are updated)
- [ ] README file is updated and explain the team's repository
- [ ] A baseline tag was generated for this Sprint (On Canvas, visit Assignment -> "Sprint 1: Confluence Space, project background and elicitation documents" page: you can find requirements for the baseline tag)
